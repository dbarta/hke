    # Above the table there will be an action bar which will have the following options:
    # - Select all rows
    # - Unselect all rows
    # - Show the table filtered by names (wild card) on both contact and deceased. This will not be autocomplete - you have to press <go>

    #   . Deceased with date next month
    #   . Deceased with date not more than n days from today
